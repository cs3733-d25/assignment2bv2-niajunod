            <p>
                My name is Nia Junod, a junior studying computer science with a minor in business.
                I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, and was adopted from Jiangxi Province in China.
                You can find me at the campus gym in the mornings.
            </p>

            <p>
                My hobby is working out, both during and outside the school year. At school, I work out
                seven times a week, and at home, I run 1-2 miles for light exercise. Since freshman year of
                high school, I've been going to the gym regularly as a way to decompress and practice self-care.
                I find that physical health improves mental health. Research shows that by working out, your body
                releases endorphins which make you happy.

                Fitness is more than just working outâ€”it's about eating healthy.
                I meal prep Monday through Friday with ground beef, rice, and mixed vegetables,
                seasoned with taco seasoning and a bit of hot sauce for extra flavor.
